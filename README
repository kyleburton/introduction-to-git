Title: 

  Introduction To Git : Level up your VCS

Abstract:

Source Code Management and Version Control Systems are tools for
helping you track your file based assets (typically source code).
Traditional SCM systems are centralized (CVS, Subversion, Visual
Source Safe), Distributed version control systmes systems provide new
capabilities, work-flows, are becoming mature and are gaining mind
share in the open source community.

Git is one of those Distributed Version Control Systems. It was
invented by the creator of Linux (Linus Torvalds) for protecting the
linux kernel source code and coordinating the activity of hundreds of
developers. This talk discusses what Distributed Version Control is,
the history of Git, basic version control features and some very
uncommon and amazing capabilities of git. Time permitting it will
include live demonstration of the tools.

Come and hear how Git has reset my expectations for what VCS tools
should be capable of and how they should perform.
